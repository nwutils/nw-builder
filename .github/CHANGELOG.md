## [3.5.7]

- The `bluebird` dependency. We're now using native promises instead.

## [3.4.0] - 2017-05-28

### Added

- If using the package programmatically and it's out of date, a message will be shown (this was always the case for the CLI).
- There is now a README in every directory (with at least a single sentence summarizing the directory) to help with onboarding contributors.

### Changed

- Some dependencies are updated.

### Removed

- `osx32` is removed from the default list of platforms. Thanks to [@preaction](https://github.compreaction) (PR [#439](https://github.com/nwjs-community/nw-builder/pull/439)).
- An unnecessary `rcedit` dependency is removed.

### Fixed

- For Node 7+ users, you won't see a `os.tmpDir` deprecation warning anymore.
